# ‚úÖ YOUR APP IS RUNNING! 

## The app is working - just follow these steps:

### STEP 1: Open the Nebula Encode window
- You should see a window with "Nebula Encode" at the top
- If you don't see it, look at your taskbar for the Electron app

### STEP 2: Remove the error file
**Look at the left side "BATCH QUEUE" area:**
- You'll see "Main 1.mp4" with red "Error" text
- Click the **"√ó"** button on the right side of that line
- OR click the **"CLEAR ALL"** button at the bottom

### STEP 3: Add a real video
**Two ways to do this:**

**Way 1 (Easiest):**
1. Click the circular area (says "DRAG & DROP")
2. A Windows file picker will open
3. Find ANY video file (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, etc.)
4. Click Open

**Way 2:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Find a video file
3. Drag it onto the circular "DRAG & DROP" area
4. Drop it

### STEP 4: Check the file was added
**In the BATCH QUEUE, you should now see:**
- Your video filename
- Status: "Idle" (in white/gray text, NOT red)
- Progress bar at 0%

If you see "Error" in red, hover your mouse over it to see why.

### STEP 5: Choose where to save (DESTINATION)
**At the bottom of the right side:**
- You'll see "DESTINATION (Click to choose output folder)"
- It should show your Desktop path
- Click it if you want to save somewhere else

### STEP 6: Start encoding!
1. Click the green **"START BATCH"** button (bottom left)
2. Watch the hyperspace animation
3. Wait for it to finish (status changes to "Done" in green)

### STEP 7: Find your encoded video
- Go to the destination folder (your Desktop by default)
- Look for: `[your_video_name]_optimized.mp4`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the app window"
- Look in your taskbar for "Nebula Encode" or "Electron"
- Click it to bring it to front

### "I still see Main 1.mp4 with error"
- That's the test file - just click the √ó button to remove it
- It has no real path, so it can't be processed

### "When I click drop zone, nothing happens"
- Make sure the app window has focus (click on it first)
- Try drag & drop instead

### "File shows Error status"
- Hover over the error to see the message
- Make sure the video file exists and isn't corrupted
- Try a different video file

### "Nothing happens when I click START BATCH"
- Did you remove the error file first?
- Did you add a valid video file?
- Is the file status "Idle" (not "Error")?
