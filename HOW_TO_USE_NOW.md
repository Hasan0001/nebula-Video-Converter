# üöÄ HOW TO USE YOUR APP RIGHT NOW

## ‚úÖ The App IS Running!

You just showed me the HTML output - that's perfect! The app is working.

## üéØ TO START ENCODING VIDEOS:

### Step 1: Clear the Error File
The "Main 1.mp4" file has no valid path. Remove it:
- **Click the "√ó" button** next to "Main 1.mp4"
- OR **Click "CLEAR ALL"** button at the bottom

### Step 2: Add Your Video File
**Choose ONE method:**

**Method A (BEST):**
1. Click the circular **"DRAG & DROP"** zone (top left of window)
2. A Windows file dialog will open
3. Navigate to your video file
4. Select it and click "Open"
5. The file will appear in the queue with status "Idle"

**Method B:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Find your video file (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, etc.)
3. Drag the file onto the circular drop zone
4. Drop it there

### Step 3: Verify File is Ready
Look at the BATCH QUEUE:
- ‚úÖ **Good**: File shows with "Idle" status (white text)
- ‚ùå **Bad**: File shows with "Error" status (red text)

If you see "Error", hover over it to see why.

### Step 4: Choose Settings (Optional)
- **CODEC**: H.265 (HEVC) = smaller files, H.264 (AVC) = compatible
- **PRESET**: Fast = good balance
- **RESOLUTION**: 3840x2160 (or click to type custom like "1920x1080")
- **BITRATE**: 8000 kbps (or adjust slider)
- **GPU ACCELERATION**: ON (if you have NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPU)

### Step 5: Select Output Folder (Important!)
- **Click** on the DESTINATION path (currently shows "C:\Users\hasan\Desktop\New folder")
- Choose where you want the encoded video saved
- OR keep it as is (will save to Desktop\New folder)

### Step 6: START ENCODING! üé¨
1. **Click "START BATCH"** button (green button, bottom left)
2. Watch the hyperspace animation
3. See the progress bar move
4. Wait for "Done" status

### Step 7: Find Your Video
Go to the destination folder - you'll see:
- `[original_name]_optimized.mp4`

## üêõ IF IT DOESN'T WORK:

### Check DevTools Console:
Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** in the app window to open DevTools.
Look for red error messages and tell me what they say.

### Common Issues:

**"No videos to process"**
- You didn't add a file, or the file has an error
- Solution: Clear queue and add a fresh video file

**"File path not available"**
- The file doesn't have a valid path
- Solution: Click the drop zone (don't drag from browser)

**"Processing failed"**
- FFmpeg couldn't encode the video
- Solution: Try H.264 codec, check video isn't corrupted
